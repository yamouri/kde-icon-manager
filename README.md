# KDE Icon Manager

This is a small program I quickly made to make life easier by allowing you to backup or load your KDE desktop icons position, when messing with multiples screen or if you lost like me the position of your icon when playing a game in a different resolution.

## How to use

1. Clone this repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yamouri/kde-icon-manager.git
    ```
2. Navigate into the project directory:
    ```bash
    cd kde-icon-manager
    ```
3. Give execution permissions to the script:
    ```bash
    chmod +x icon_manager.sh
    ```
4. Run the script:
    ```bash
    ./icon_manager.sh
    ```

Once the script is running, follow the on-screen options to either backup or load your icons. For more details, check the screenshot provided.
